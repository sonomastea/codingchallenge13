# codingchallenge13
This coding challenge was to develop a dynamic coding application that displays products from an API Url. We also implemented error handling, loading, previous and next buttons,etc. We also had to implement a style.css to add detail and personalization to the assignment. This was the fun part for me, this assignment was defintley a challenge and I learned alot!
